Alexander Ngu defines intelligence as a formalization of generality, represented by the abstraction ∆∞Ο or (Delta-Infinity-Omicron), where each symbol represents the concepts infinitesimal, infinite, and finite respectively. 

Abstract

This paper aims to formalize a general definition of intelligence beyond human intelligence.
We accomplish this by re-imagining the concept of equality as a fundamental abstraction
for relation. We discover that the concept of equality = limits the sensitivity of our
mathematics to abstract relationships. We propose a new relation principle that does not
rely on the concept of equality but is consistent with existing mathematical abstractions. In
essence, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for general interaction and argues that
this framework is also an abstraction that satisfies the definition of Intelligence. Hence we
define intelligence as a formalization of generality, represented by the abstraction ∆∞Ο,
where each symbol represents the concepts infinitesimal, infinite, and finite respectively. In
essence, this paper proposes a General Language Model (GLM), where the abstraction
∆∞Ο represents the foundational relationship of the model. This relation is colloquially
termed ‘The theory of everything’.
